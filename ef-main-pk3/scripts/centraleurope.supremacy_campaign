	description		"1943. The Axis High Command has ordered a strategic withdrawal from the 'remote and ultimately insignificant' North African theatre and their forces are busy fortifying the Atlantic coastline in expectation of Allied raids and an eventual invasion.**The Allies have much work to do before they can hope to mount a successful invasion attempt and must gain expertise in both beach and parachute landings. Clearly, the next phase of conflict will be critical."
