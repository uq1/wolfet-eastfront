// ETPub mod - Sample Shrubbot.cfg file
//
// Updated for ETPub 0.6.3
//
// Shrubbot is an invention of Ryan Mannion. etpub tries to clone shubbot as
// accurately as possible, both in user interface and in the shrubbot
// configuration file (usually called "shrubbot.cfg"). Below are the shrubbot
// commands that etpub currently supports and the corresponding flag to be used
// in the shrubbot config file to give permission to the command:
//
// !readconfig (G)
// !time (C)
// !setlevel (s)
// !kick (k)
// !ban (b)
// !unban (b)
// !putteam (p)
// !pause (Z)
// !unpause (Z)
// !listplayers (i)
// !mute (m)
// !unmute (m)
// !showbans (B)
// !help (h)
// !admintest (a)
// !cancelvote (c)
// !passvote (V)
// !spec999 (P)
// !shuffle (S)
// !rename (N)
// !gib (g)
// !slap (A)
// !burn (U)
// !warn (R)
// !news (W)
// !lock (K)
// !unlock (K)
// !lol (x)
// !restart (r)
// !reset (r)
// !swap (w)
// !pip (z)
// !pop (z)
// !fling/launch/throw (l)
// !flinga/launcha/throwa (L)
// !listteams (I)
// !disorient (d)
// !orient (d)
// !resetxp (X)
// !nextmap (n)
// !resetmyxp (M)
//
// NOTE: For a full description of each command, including its usage, see the
// etpub docs.
//
// The following flags are also supported:
//
// 1 - cannot be vote kicked, vote muted, dropped from inactivity, or complained
//     against.
// 2 - cannot be censored
// 3 - Can run commands silently with /!COMMAND in the console
// 4 - Can see Axis/Allies team chats as a spectator
// 5 - can switch teams any time, regardless of balance
// 6 - does not need to specify a reason for !kick or !ban
// 7 - can call a vote at any time, regardless of voting being disabled
//     or voting limitations
// 8 - does not need to specify a duration for a ban (defaults to PERMANENT)
// 9 - Can do shrubbot commands via team and fireteam chats
//
// The following operators are supported in the flags field:
//
// * - This means all available commands are allowed. Any flags that come after
//     the * are negated. So for example:
//
// [level]
// level   = 5
// name    =
// flags   = *xU
//
//     would give level 5 admins all commands except !lol and !burn.
// - - This subtracts the flags that follow it from the allowed flags. Example:
//
// [admin]
// name    = tjw
// guid    = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
// level   = 5
// flags   = -bs
//
//     would give tjw all of the commands a level 5 admin has except !ban and
//     !setlevel.
//     NOTE: this operator is for admin flags only.
// + - This is pretty useless since it is implied that any flags will be
//     appended anyway unless they follow '-'. Therefore, the only use for this
//     operator is for use after the '-' operator. Example:
//
// [admin]
// name    = tjw
// guid    = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
// level   = 5
// flags   = -bs+U
//
//     would give tjw all of the commands a level 5 user has except !ban and
//     !setlevel, but he also gets the !burn command which typical level 5
//     admins do not have.
//     NOTE: this operator is for admin flags only.
//
// The configuration file itself is layed out in blocks serpated by blank lines.
// The three types of blocks supported are [level], [admin], and [ban]. If you
// ever need to edit the shrubbot.cfg file by hand, you need to run the
// !readconfig command (or restart etded) to load it.
//
// When setting up a new shrubbot.cfg file, simply set the g_shrubbot cvar to
// the name you want to use for the configuration file, then connect to the
// server with your et, and run the following command in the server console:
//
// !setlevel ETPlayer 5
//
// (where ETPlayer is your name). This will create the shrubbot.cfg file with
// default levels and your guid set to level 5 admin (the highest allowed
// level). You can then edit the level definitions in this file to match your
// preferences and run the !readconfig command to load them up.
