* josh: Added antilag debug output to the client for internal testing only
        This client will also make the server hitboxes blue when g_debugBullets
        is on and it will draw red hitboxes for what the client sees. Output
        is on the console.
* tjw:  used new PM_TraceAll() from 2.60 in playdead checking
* tjw:  improved PM_TraceAll() related checking to test for players heads
        and legs instead of just legs.  This should prevent player models
        from sticking through doors when prone or dead next to them.

* tjw:  "Project: Bug Fix" 037 merged (cgame)
* tjw:  "Project: Bug Fix" 049 merged (cgame and ui)
* tjw:  added 'forcecvar' server command.  this will of course only work
        if using the client mod.  unmodified clients will see the message
        "Unknown client game command: forcecvar".
* tjw:  improved etpromapscripts compatibility.  need client mod in order
        to see "You are near the Back Door" popup.

20050526
--------
* tjw:  client mod won't draw the wounded message when playing dead.
* tjw:  client mod won't predict EV_NOFIRE_UNDERWATER.  this means if
        you're using g_weapons 2 or 4 flags, you won't hear clicking
	when using syringe or pliers underwater.
* tjw:  removed +lookup, -lookup, +lookdown, and -lookdown commands from the
        client mod.  these are used for anti-recoil cheats.
* tjw:  etpub_client now tries very hard not to save any of the forcecvar
        cvars in the profile etconfig.cfg file.  also, once forcecvar is 
        used to set a client cvar, the client can no longer modify it
	(until they restart their client).

20050927
--------
* tjw:  I made a mistake merging Project: Bug Fix 049.  (thanks for pointing it
        out Chruker).  this has to do with map name drawing in etpub_client.
* tjw:  Added check for vote_allow_maprestart in vote menu
* tjw:  added several 2.60 files to the SVN repo that were missing
* josh: The client is now aware of double jump so it can better predict the
        effects. This means people double jumping should be able to aim better.
* matt: added cg_drawTime, cg_drawTimeSeconds, to draw local time
        underneath the FPS display, cg_drawTime can be 0 (not displayed),
        1 (24 hr clock) or 2 (12 hour clock with am/pm). cg_drawTimeSeconds
        will display seconds
* matt: added etpub menu option, with HUD customization choices for
        customizing the drawing of local time (see cg_drawTime, 
        cg_drawTimeSeconds)  Also added options for atmosphericeffects
        (rain/snow), cg_drawFPS, cg_drawLagometer
* matt: added weapons/binocs.weap for proper display of binocs dropped
* matt: added weapons/knife.weap for proper display of throwing knives
* forty: Zinx's b_realhead code 
* forty: "Project: Bug Fix" 020 merged (cgame) 
* matt:  preliminary integration of bacon's editable hud code from SD forums
         client-side commands, /loadhud, /edithud, /dumphud
         example hud hud/stumpy.hud added
* matt:  Fixed bug in hud file loading that caused MinGW compiled clients
         to stop displaying the chat areas
* tjw:   Added etpubc.h and server version detection.  You can now use
         the macro ETPUB_VERSION() and the variable cgs.etpub to enable
         features in the client depending on what version of etpub the
         server is running.  Example:
         if(cgs.etpub >= ETPUB_VERSION(0,6,0)) ...
         This could potentially be useful for adding config strings.
* matt:  Added preliminary etpub client documentation
* tjw:   decreased the text size for polls.
* tjw:   added the /hidevote client command.  also, the "stuck vote"
         bug that people experience when joining durring a vote is 
         most likely fixed.
* tjw:   updated the vote menu to include new etpub votes 
         ("next campaign", "restart campaign", "surrender", and "poll")
* tjw:   used Catscratch's suggestion for putting etpubclient version
         in place of "SERVER INFO" on the loading screen.
* perro: updated client to allow for adjusting stamina recharge rates
         (g_staminaRecharge) and to support g_misc 16 to prevent 
         jumping if stamina is below approx 17%.  Updated etpubc.h to show
         20050927
* tjw:   added etpub 0.5.x version detection hack
* tjw:   added version detection for PM_Tracehead() now g_misc 32
* tjw:   /hidevote wasn't working correctly.  It would get reset every
         time the vote totals changed.

20051016
--------
* perro: updated client to reflect g_staminarecharge changes
* matt:  added 4 new hud elements, cpmtext, chattest, livesleft, votefttext
* matt:  fixed it so that compass zoom level now sticks across maps 
         and sessions
* perro: updated client to show newer obits (poison, goomba, fear, 
         throwing knife, reflected-ff)
         cleaned up minor formatting issue with fireteam invitation text
         that caused two lines to print over one another
* tjw:   implemented g_coverts 2 and 4 flags (see docs)
* tjw:   added menu option for shufflenorestart vote
* tjw:   added scale parameter to "livesleft" HUD element and adjusted
         deej.hud and stumpy.hud to draw this element.  It only gets drawn
         on limited lives server anyway right?

20051030
--------
* kw:    added cg_panzerhack (default: 1) to put your SMG in weaponbank 2
         (instead of bank 3) when you're a soldier with level 4 Heavy Weapons.
* kw:    client now shows your throwing knives ammo count 
         ([current ammo]/[max ammo])
* tjw:   support for the g_coverts 128 flag

20051103
--------
* josh:  bugfix: Changed PMF_DOUBLEJUMPING bitflag from 65536 to 128 since
         only 16-bits are sent over to the client. This fixes a client bug,
         since it is in bg, but is compiled into the server as well. Double
         jumps should be right now. Thanks Zozz!
* tjw:   fixed stamina recharge bug when playing on non etpub 0.6.x servers.

20051128
--------
* kw:    etmain bugfix: lastWeaponInBank wasn't reset after respawn causing
         weapon switching to not respond the first time in a case.
* kw:    fixed the configstrings command exploit.
         fixed cg_bobup exploit.
         fixed cg_errordecay was still exploitable.
* kw:    fixed 2 thirdperson bugs (thanks jaquboss).
* kw:    campaign info sometimes wasn't shown when the server had a lot of
         campaigns.
* kw:    maps+hostgame menus should now show a lot more maps/campaigns in 
         the lists.
* kw:    fixed 2 crash bugs in the maps+hostgame menus.
* tjw:   only draw ammo for knife if g_throwableKnives is enabled on the
         server
* tjw:   always draw knife ammo if the server is etpub 0.6.0 through 0.6.2
* tjw:   send /throwknife cmd for alt fire with knife selected if the server
         supports g_throwableKnives
