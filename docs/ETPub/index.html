<dl>

<dt>g_shrubbot [filename]
<dd>
<p>This should be set to the name of your shrubbot.cfg file if you want to
enable shrubbot.  See <a href="#shrubbot">shrubbot</a> documentation for
more information about this file.</p>
<p>Example:<pre>g_shrubbot "shrubbot.cfg"</pre></p>
<p>This depends on punkbuster's guid, so don't turn this on unless you
have punkbuster enabled on your server.</p>
<p>Default is "" (Disabled)</p>

<dt>g_logAdmin [filename]
<dd>
<p>The name of the file that all shrubbot commands will be logged to.  For example, 
<pre>g_logAdmin "admin.log"</pre></p>
<p>Default is "" (no log file)</p>

<dt>g_hitsounds [integer]
<dd>
This is a bitflag cvar that supports the following values
	<dl>
	<dt>1
	<dd>enables hitsounds
	<dt>2
	<dd>disables hitsounds when shooting wounded players.
	<dt>4
	<dd>disable the headshot sounds when shooting wounded players
            in the head.   default hitsound will be used in it's place
	    unless the 2 flag is set.
	<dt>8
	<dd>disable the &quot;hold your fire&quot; sound that would normally
            be played when shooting a teammate for the first time.
	<dt>16
	<dd>disable hitsounds from poison damage.
	</dl>
A client will hear a sound when they damage another player.
The sounds it uses are ones that are included in the pak0.pk3 file so it
does not require additonal file downloads to use this mod.
<p>
A client can
disable hitsounds by running <pre>/setu cg_hitsounds 0</pre> before connecting
to the server, or toggle hitsounds on the fly with the /hitsounds command.
<br><br>
Starting with 0.1.1, the hitsounds used are configurable with the following cvars:<pre>
g_hitsound_default (Default is "sound/weapons/impact/flesh2.wav")
g_hitsound_helmet (Default is "sound/weapons/impact/metal4.wav")
g_hitsound_head (Default is "sound/weapons/impact/flesh4.wav")
g_hitsound_team_warn_axis (Default is "sound/chat/axis/26a.wav")
g_hitsound_team_warn_allies (Default is "sound/chat/axis/26a.wav")
g_hitsound_team_helmet (Default is "sound/weapons/impact/metal4.wav")
g_hitsound_team_head (Default is "sound/weapons/impact/flesh4.wav")
g_hitsound_team_default (Default is "sound/weapons/impact/flesh2.wav")
</pre>
<p>Note that these are server cvars.  If you want to use hitsounds that are not included in
the game you'll have to put them in a pk3 for all clients to download. Your custom hitsounds
must be 22khz, 16 bit, mono WAV files in order for ET to be able to use them.</p>

<dt>g_shoveSound [string]
<dd>
<p>
The sound that a player emits when shoved.  Set this to &quot;&quot; to
disable it.
</p>
<p>
Default is &quot;sound/weapons/grenade/gren_throw.wav&quot;

<dt>g_poisonSound [string]
<dd>
<p>The sound that a poisoned player emits every second.  Set this to
&quot;&quot; to disable it.
</p>
<p>
Default is &quot;sound/player/gurp2.wav&quot;
</p>

<dt>g_fightSound [string]
<dd>
<p>
The sound that will play at the end of warmup or when the match
is unpaused.
</p>
<p>
Example <pre>
set g_fightSound "sound/world/rooster.wav"</pre>
</p>
<p>
Set this to &quot;&quot; to disable it.
</p>
<p>
Default is &quot;&quot;
</p>

<dt>g_playDead [0|1]
<dd>
<p>Allows players use the 'playdead' command and their character
will act like it is dead until the playdead command is issued again (or they
really die).</p>
<p>Default is 0</p>

<dt>g_shove [integer]
<dd>Allows players to push other players with the "use" key.  The integer
adjusts the amount of force players shove with.  80 seems fair.
<p>
NOTE: starting with etpub 0.5.1, this number has been changed to (hopefully)
be more compatible with the value used in shrubet.  You will need to turn
down this value greatly when upgrading from earlier versions of etpub.
</p>
<p>
Default is 0.
</p>

<dt>g_shoveNoZ [0|1]
<dd>
<p>
Set this to 1 if you want to disable shove in the up/down direction
(a.k.a &quot;boosting&quot;).
<p>
Default is 0
</p>

<dt>g_dragCorpse [0|1]
<dd>
<p>Allows players do drag wounded players with the use key when moving
backward slowly.  Works best when crouching or prone.</p>
<p>Default is 0</p>

<dt>g_classChange [0|1]
<dd>
<p>Allows players to take the class of a gibbed teammate temporarily similarly
to how a covert steals a uniform.  Class changing does not latch, so the
original class the player had will be restored on respawn.</p>
<p>Default is 0</p>

<dt>g_forceLimboHealth [0|1]
<dd>
<p>If set to 0 it takes about 3 shots to gib a wounded player, if set to 1
it takes about 5.</p>
<p>Default is 1</p>

<dt>g_privateMessages [0|1]
<dd>
<p>
If set to 1, players can send private messages to one another with the m
command.  Example: <pre>/m tjw you totally suck!</pre>
</p>
<p>
Starting in 0.2.1 players can also type '/m tjw you totally suck' in the
'chat' dialog box and it will be recognized as a private message.
</p>

<p>
Starting in 0.5.1, clients can reject private message from other
individual clients with the /ignore client command.
</p>

<p>
Default is 0
</p>

<dt>g_XPSave [integer]
<dd>
<p>If set to 1, XP and number of lives remaining will be saved if a player
disconnects and reconnects later during the same campaign.
As of 0.1.1, this is now a bitflag with the following values:</p>
<dl>
<dt>1<dd>store xp when a client disconnects
<dt>2<dd>don't reset xp to the pre-map start values on a map restart,
shuffle, etc.
<dt>4<dd>never reset xp (ever).
<dt>8<dd>force the disconnection of clients with the same GUID as the connecting
    client.  This is useful in saving the stored XP of players with unreliable
    network connections since they should still get their stored XP even if
    reconnecting immediately with a new IP address.<br>
    This feature is enabled by default unless you have sv_wwwDlDisconnected
    enabled.   sv_wwwDlDisconnected seems to interfere with this feature, so
    do not enable this flag if you change pk3's on your server often because
    stored XP will be lost over disconencted downloads.
</dl>
<p>Storing XP on disconnect depends
on the punkbuster guid, so don't turn this on unless you have punkbuster
enabled on your server.</p>
<p>Default is 0</p>

<a name="g_XPSaveFile"></a>
<dt>g_XPSaveFile [string]
<dd>
<p>
Set this to the filename you want XPSave to store data in.  This file
will be relative to your fs_game directory (like g_shrubbot).
</p>
<p>Default is &quot;xpsave.cfg&quot;
</p>

<a name="g_XPSaveMaxAge_xp"></a>
<dt>g_XPSaveMaxAge_xp [integer]
<dd>
<p>
The number of seconds that must pass without a connection from this
player before XPSave forgets his/her xp skills.
<p>
NOTE: if <a href="#g_XPSaveMaxAge">g_XPSaveMaxAge</a> is less than
g_XPSaveMaxAge_xp, g_XPSaveMaxAge will be used.
</p>
</p>
<p>Default is 86400 (a.k.a 1 day)
</p>

<a name="g_XPSaveMaxAge"></a>
<dt>g_XPSaveMaxAge [integer]
<dd>
<p>
The number of seconds that must pass without a connection from this
player before XPSave forgets his/her skills/killrating/playerrating/mute
status.
</p>
<p>
See also <a href="#g_XPSaveMaxAge_xp">g_XPSaveMaxAge_xp</a>
</p>
</p>
<p>Default is 604800 (a.k.a 1 week)
</p>

<a name="g_XPDecay"></a>
<dt>g_XPDecay [integer]
<dd>
<p>This is a bitmask that controls the XP decay feature.  The following
bitflags are supported:
	<dl>
	<dt>1
	<dd>Enable XP Decay
	<dt>2
	<dd>Do not decay a player's XP when they are disconnected from the
	    server.
	<dt>4
	<dd>Do not decay a player's XP for the class they are currently playing
            as (e.g. Medic).
	<dt>8
	<dd>Do not decay a player's XP while they are spectating.
	<dt>16
	<dd>Do not decay a player's XP during warmup/intermission.
	<dt>32
	<dd>Do not decay a player's XP when he/she is playing.  This means
            that they are on a Allies or Axis and the game is active.

	<dt>64
	<dd>Do not decay a player's <b>Battle Sense</b> XP when he/she is
            playing. 
	<dt>128
	<dd>Do not decay a player's <b>Light Weapons</b> XP when he/she is
            playing.  
	</dl>
<p>See also <a href="#g_XPDecayRate">g_XPDecayRate</a>.
<p>This feature was created in response to the g_XPSave 4 flag which allows
XP to continue building forever.
<p>Default is 0

<a name="g_XPDecayRate">
<dt>g_XPDecayRate [float]
<dd>
<p>
This is the rate (in skillpoints per second) that XP skill points for each 
skill will decay when <a href="#g_XPDecay">g_XPDecay</a> is enabled.
<p>
Setting this to 0.1 would result in a player losing 6 points per minute IN ALL 
SKILLS, so up to 42XP per minute if the player has skill points for each skill.
 
<p>Default is 0.0

<a name="g_XPDecayFloor">
<dt>g_XPDecayFloor [float]
<dd>
<p>
This is the minimum that any particular skill can be reduced to by g_XPDecay.
</p>
<p>
For example, setting this to 140.0 will ensure that no player will ever lose
rank or skill levels due to g_XPDecay.
</p>
<p>Default is 0.0

<a name="g_maxXP">
<dt>g_maxXP [integer]
<dd>
<p>
This is a vicious cvar that will reset a players XP once their overall XP
score reaches it.  It has been requested by those who run servers with XPSave
that never resets.
<p>
Set this to -1 to disable it.
<p>
Default is -1 (disabled)

<a name="g_damageXP">
<dt>g_damageXP [integer]
<dd>
<p>Optionally enables the awarding of XP based upon the amount of damage
a player has done to the opposing team.</p>
<p>Available options are:</p>
	<dl>

	<dt>0
	<dd>disabled: use normal ET XP awarding methods

	<dt>1
	<dd>1 point of XP is awarded per g_damageXPLevel points of damage done.
	The XP is placed in the skill category of the weapon used.

	a fixed value of 1 point of XP.

	<dt>2
	<dd>1 point of XP is awarded per g_damageXPLevel points of damage done.
	The XP is placed in the Battle Sense category.  
	Normal XP amounts are awarded for kills (typically 3-5 XP).

<a name="g_damageXPLevel">
<dt>g_damageXPLevel [integer]
<dd>
<p>This setting determines the amount of damage that a player must do to earn
1 point of XP.  See g_damageXP for additional information.</p>

<a name="g_weapons" /></a>
<dt>g_weapons [bitmask]
<dd>
<p>This is meant to match the shrubmod g_weapons cvar, but so far the only
implemented flags are:</p>
<dl>
<dt> 2
<dd>syringes work underwater
<dt> 4
<dd>pliers work underwater
<dt> 8
<dd>Fully restore Field ops charge bar if airstrike is aborted

<dt> 32
<dd>ammo packs restore helmets
<dt> 64
<dd>drop binoculars if player has them (requires etpub_client >= 20050927 or
/weapons/binocs.weap in a pk3 file downloaded to the client)
<dt> 128
<dd>soldiers with level 4 heavy weapons don't lose their pistols

<dt> 1024
<dd>creates a hitbox for mortar shells.  This reduces (or eliminates   
in some cases) the ability to fire mortars through smaller   
windows and bunker slits. 
</dl>
<p>Default is 0</p>

<dt>g_goomba [integer]
<dd>
<p>
If set to a positive integer, players can damage each other by landing
on each other.   The integer is multiplier that determines how much
damage should be done to the player that was fallen on.  Also
the impact for the falling player will be broken so that they
only recieve 20% of the damage they would have normally.  It is also
possible to do small amounts of damage (5HP) to other players by hopping
up and down on them.
</p>

<p>
Falling damage can be either 500, 50, 25, 15, or 10 depending on
the length of the fall.  So if you set g_goomba to 5 and land on a
player from a fall that would have damaged you 10HP, you will inflict
50HP of damage on the player you land on, and you will only recieve 2HP of
damage.
</p>

<p>
See also <a href="#g_goombaFlags">g_goombaFlags</a>

	<dt>4
	<dd>Short falls (hopping) does no damage to teammates.
	    (not necessary if 1 or 2 flag is set)
	<dt>8
	<dd>Falling player recieves no damage when landing on any other

            would have given if not landing on a player).
	<dt>16
	<dd>Insta-gib goomba.  All goomba damage will be 500HP regardless

<p>If set to 0, players are allowed one non-killing team change per respawn cycle.  If a player changes teams, he will be instantly spawned in the other teams default spawn point.  Players will die (but not lose a life) if they change teams
a second time in one spawn cycle.</p>

<dt>g_ATB [0|1|2]
<dt>g_ATB_diff [integer]
<dd>
<p>
g_ATB controls the type of active team balancing you want to use. Active team
balancing will automatically move one of the top three player(s) from the
team more likely to win, to the team more likely to lose. There are currently
two versions. One uses XP, the other playerrating. Set g_ATB to choose between
them. Note that g_ATB only decides WHEN to move a player, and NOT which player
to move. See <a href="#g_ATB_rating">g_ATB_rating</a> to see how ATB chooses
which player to move.
	<dl>
	<dt>0
	<dd>No active team balancing.
	<dt>1
	<dd>Use team XP to balance the teams. Uses the following cvars:
		<dl>
		<dt>g_ATB_minXP [integer]
		<dt>g_ATB_minPlayers [integer]
		<dt>g_ATB_axisHoldoff [integer]
		<dt>g_ATB_alliedHoldoff [integer]
		<dd>
		<p>Active Team Balance watches the team XP during the match and will force
		one of the top 3 players from the dominant team to switch teams when
		his/her team hits it's respawn time if the following criteria is met:</p>
		<ol>
		<li>One team has at least g_ATB_minXP (default 300) team XP.
		<li>There are at least g_ATB_minPlayers (default 5) players playing
		<li>The resulting team change will not give one team an advantage by number of players unless:
			<ol>
			<li>If 16 or more people are playing, the losing team may get up to a
				1 player advantage.
			<li>If 26 or more people are playing, the losing team may get up to a
				2 player advantage.
			</ol>
		<li>The winning team is ahead in team XP by a margin of g_ATB_fidd
		 percent.
		</ol>
		<p>For example, setting <pre>g_ATB_diff 50</pre> a player would be
		moved if he/she was the top player on the team and his/her team had 750XP and
		the other team had 500XP.</p>
		<p>You can also adjust the rate at which ATB moves players with the
		g_ATB_axisHoldoff (default 5)  and g_ATB_alliedHoldoff (default 5) cvars.
		For example, if g_ATB_axisHoldoff is set to 5 and an axis player is moved
		to the allied team, ATB will take no other action until the axis spawn timer
		cycles 5 times.</p>
		<p>NOTE: this calculation is based on <b>TeamXP</b> NOT the total XP of all
		the players on the team.  TeamXP is the total score earned for the team by
		all players on the team during the map.  When a player changes teams, the
		TeamXP they earned for their team does not move with them.</p>
		<p>Default values:</p>
		<p>
		g_ATB_diff: 75<br>
		g_ATB_minXP: 300<br>
		g_ATB_minPlayers: 5<br>
		g_ATB_axisHoldoff: 5<br>
		g_ATB_alliedHoldoff: 5
		</p>
		</dl>
	<dt>2
	<dd>Use player rating to balance the teams. This will balance the teams by
	moving one of the the top 3 players when the probability of one team winning
	exceeds g_ATB_diff. g_ATB_diff is an integer and defaults
	to 75 meaning 75%. If the Axis team has more than a 75% chance of winning,
	ATB will move one of its players to the Allies, and this will often instantly
	lower the probability enough that another move will not be necessary. This
	version will not use any of the XP version's variables and it uses
	<a href="#g_playerRating_minplayers">g_playerRating_minplayers</a>
	instead of g_ATB_minPlayers as the minimum number of players that must
	be playing before it will act. It will also not swap players between teams
	since unbalanced team numbers is fine with player rating. It will actually
	stack team numbers on purpose to even out the teams unless g_ATB_swap is
	set.
	<p>
	Note: Read 
	<a href="#g_teamForceBalance_playerrating">g_teamForceBalance_playerrating</a>
	carefully also. You probably don't want to turn option 2 on until after
	running your server long enough to learn map and player stats.
	</p>
	<p>
	<b>NOTE: you must set g_ATB_rating to 4 and g_shuffle_rating to 4 if
                 you use g_ATB 2 or ATB will by hyperactive and ineffective</b>

<dt>g_skipCorrection [1|0]
<dd>
Set this to 1 to enable Neil Toronto's unlagged2 skip correction.
This will smooth out the movement of players with high packet loss
(to a degree).
This is similar to etpro's antiwarp, but has some differences.
Neil likes this version better, bani likes his better.
<br><br>
This replaces g_smoothClients from etmain.
<br><br>
You can find a demo that shows g_skipCorrection in action at:
<a href="http://et.tjw.org/etpub/skipCorrection/">
http://et.tjw.org/etpub/skipCorrection/</a>
<br><br>
Defaults to 1 (on)

<dt>g_maxWarp [integer]
<dd>
This allows you to control the amount of "warping" that players with
high packet loss can do.  The [integer] is the number of server frames
that you allow a player to miss before their next movement is put in
check.
<br><br>
A server frame is 50ms on a typical server (sv_fps set to 20).  This
means that if you set g_maxWarp to 5 you won't allow players to warp
from point A to point B if that distance takes an normal player 1/4
of a second to travel. Setting this to 1 is a good way to drive off
just about everyone from your server.
<br><br>
As far as I can tell, 1000ms is allowed by default in the game, so
setting this to any value higher than 39 should have no effect if
sv_fps is set to 10.
<br><br>
You can find a demo that shows g_maxWarp in action at:

<p>When greater than 0, anybody that has this percentage of hits inflicted on a
teammate will automatically be kicked.  A minimum of g_minhits hits total required
before this is calculated.  Client can see current stats for themselves by doing a

are other ways to implement this feature, which may be implemented in addition to
current manner.</p>
<p>Default is 0</p>

<dt>g_minHits [integer]
<dd>
<p>Minimum number of damaging hits required before calculating if player has
reached g_teamDamageRestriction threshold.  Flamethrower and landmine hits are
adjusted similar to shrub.  Medics get -2 hits for every revive.</p>
<p>Default is 6</p>

<dt>g_truePing [0|1]
<dd>
<p>Allows players to see the true amount of time it takes until their
actions are processed on the server. Pings will show around 50 ms higher
than normal, but it's more accurate. Shows in the scoreboard.</p>
<p>Default is 0</p>

<dt>g_dropObj [integer]
<dd>
Sets the number of times a player can drop/toss the objective
(e.g. parts on radar) per life.<br><br>
The parts are dropped by pressing the +activate key
(usually bound to F) when there's nothing else around to be
activated.
<br><br>
Before enabling this recall how spammy the voiceovers can be.
Then picture a player tossing the parts to himself over and
over again.  For this reason you probably don't want to set
this very high.
<br><br>
Starting in 0.4.4 players must switch to knife in order to drop the
objective.  If they are not holding knife and hit +activate they will
see a message that notifies them that they must switch to knife.  This
change was made to prevent accidental dropping of the objective when
trying to push, drag, pick up, or activate something else.
<br><br>
Default is 0.

<dt>g_doubleJumpHeight [float]
<dd>Adjusts the height of the second jump in a double jump.  This value is a
multiplier to the default jump velocity.  The greater g_doubleJumpHeight is,
the greater the height of the second jump.  This setting has no effect if
double jump is disabled in g_misc.  The default value of 1.4 matches shrub's
double jump.

<p>
These variables allow customization of the experience points necessary to go
up in ranks.  These settings consist of four space-separated integers
indicating the number of XP required to go up a rank.  A string such as
"3 10 10 10" indicates that 3 points are required to go up the first rank,
and the next three ranks are granted when the players has 10 points.  If, for
example, you want to grant akimbo pistols upon the first kill, you would set
skill_lightweapons to "3 3 3 3".  The default for each of these variables is
"20 50 90 140"
</p>

<dt>g_serverInfo [integer]
<dd>
Use this cvar to change the behaviour of the 'serverinfo' string.  This string
is printed in response to the 'getstatus' primative command used by
game browsers.  This is a bitflag cvar that currently accepts the
following flags:
	<dl>
	<dt>1
	<dd>
	Display player team information using the 'P' cvar in the server info
	string. (etpro and etmain 2.60 behaviour)
	<dt>2
	<dd>
	Display player team information using the 'Players_Axis' and
	'Players_Allies' cvars in the server info string.
	(etmain < 2.60 behaviour)
	<dt>4
	<dd>
	Display the 'campaign_maps' cvar in the server info string.  This
	contains a comma delimited list off all the maps in the current
	campaign.  Only works if you have g_gametype set to 4.
	<dt>8
	<dd>
	Displays the 'C' CVAR in the server info string.  This is a string
	containing the current map number in the campaign, and total maps in
	current campaign, in the form of &quot;xx,yy&quot;.  Only works if
	you have g_gametype set to 4.
	<dt>16
	<dd>
	Starting with 0.5.1, the class charge times will not be present
	in the server info string unless this flag is set.   They were
	removed by default in order to make room in the serverInfo string
	for more useful information.
	These cvars are g_medicChargeTime, g_engineerChargeTime,
	g_LTChargeTime, g_covertopChargeTime, g_soldierChargeTime.
	</dl>
<p>
NOTE: <b>this cvar MUST be set prior to loading the first map.</b>  You
will not be able to change this cvar once the game code is loaded.
</p>

<p>
NOTE: the serverInfo string has a fixed length of 1024 characters.  This
space is shared with any cvar you create on your server with the 'sets'
command.  If you use up too much space with 'sets', your server will
fail to start.  It will print the message
&quot;Info string length exceeded&quot; if you don't have enough space left
in your serverinfo string to handle the g_serverInfo flags you've selected.
To fix this, either remove some sets cvars from your config, or use
different g_serverInfo flags.
<p>
Default is 1.

<a name="g_killRating"></a>
<dt>g_killRating [integer]
<dd>
g_killRating is a bitflag variable.
<br><br>
When not set to 0 etpub will track a player's killing ability using an
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELO_rating_system">ELO type statistic</a>
similar to chess. Each kill will increase a player's kill rating
based on how hard the kill was. Killing unskilled players will result in very
few points whereas an unskilled player killing a skilled player will result in
more points. Kill rating also takes into account the weapon used (less for
arty, more for knife).
<br><br>
Here are the bitflag options:
	<dl>
	<dt>1
	<dd>Use kill rating. A dummy flag since any non-zero value for g_killRating
	    will enable it.
	<dt>2
	<dd>Make kill rating visible. Players can use /killrating and at the end of
	    each map a message will display the top killers for the map and
	    overall.
	</dl>
<p>
NOTE: in 0.5.x there was a 4 flag that allowed killRating to be used for
shuffle.  This has been depriciated.  This is now controlled through the
<a href="#g_shuffle_rating">g_shuffle_rating</a> cvar.

<a name="g_playerRating"></a>
<dt>g_playerRating [integer]
<dd>
g_playerRating is a bitflag variable.
<br><br>
When not set to 0 etpub will track a player's ability to win against good teams
using an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELO_rating_system">
ELO type statistic</a> similar to chess. Each win will increase a player's
rating based on how hard the opposing team was. Skilled teams defeating less
skilled teams will result in very few points whereas an relatively low-
rated team defeating a good team will result in more points. Player rating also
takes into account the number of players on each team (less points when a very
large defeats a small one) and which side tends to win more often on the
current map (e.g. Allies tend to win tc_base).
<br><br>
Here are the bitflag options:
	<dl>
	<dt>1
	<dd>Use player rating. A dummy flag since any non-zero value for g_playerRating
	    will enable it.
	<dt>2
	<dd>Make player rating visible. Players can use /playerrating and at the end of

<a name="g_playerRating_minplayers"></a>
<dt>g_playerRating_minplayers [integer]
<dd>
<p>
The minimum number of players that must participate in a map in order for it
to count towards each player's player rating.
</p>
<p>Default is 8 (e.g. 4v4)
</p>

<a name="g_teamForceBalance_playerrating"></a>
<dt>g_teamForceBalance_playerrating [0..100]
<dd>
<p>
Set to 0 to disable.  <i>If this setting is enabled, it overrides g_teamForceBalance.</i>
If g_teamForceBalance_playerrating is non-zero, etpub will
not allow players to join a team whose chances of winning are already above
g_teamForceBalance_playerrating. The winning chance is calculated using 3 things:
the average player rating of the team, the number of players on each team, and
how often each team wins the current map (e.g. Allies usually win tc_base). If
the team being joined rates too highly, a message will tell the player to join
the other team.
<br><br>
Important Notes:
<br>
First of all, g_teamForceBalance_playerrating WILL allow unbalanced numbers to
offset map or team difficulty. If the Axis has VERY good players, it will allow
the Allies to have a few more players than Axis, given a map that is equally
difficult for both sides to win. Also, given teams equal in skill,
g_teamForceBalance_playerrating will force Allies to have a large team if the
map is almost always won by Axis.
<br><br>
Because g_teamForceBalance_playerrating uses info tracked over time, it may be
best to run through your cycle or campaign a few times without it before turning
it on, so that it can learn how good the players are, and how hard the maps are.
<br><br>
If you want an idea why it's working a certain way, use the !listteams command
server console (or game). This will show you how many points each team is
predicted to win. If a team is going to win less than 4 points, it's too good.
The other information shows you the breakdown of how the points are calculated.
<br>
<pre>
Ratings       Win Prob       Win Points
---------------------------------------------
Allies          0.65            5
Axis            0.35           10
</pre>
The above says that Axis has a 35% chance of winning based on the players and
map. It takes into account the number of players per team also. The points
are calculated as 16*(1 - win prob). So there you have it.
<br><br>
Remember, g_teamForceBalance_playerrating is contantly adapting, so if it seems
dumb at first, give it some time to adapt to your server. Maybe don't turn it on
for the first week.

This is a bitflag cvar used to control the way statistics are handled.
The following flags are supported:
	<dl>
	<dt>1
	<dd>When shooting a corpse to gib, do not count it as a hit.

<p>Default is 0</p>

<a name="g_tyranny"></a>
<dt>g_tyranny [0|1]
<dd>
<p>
This cvar controls the use of administrator commands that could
be used by admins to cheat or abuse players.  If it is set to
0 you will not be able to use commands on your server such as !gib,
!slap, !burn, etc.
</p>
<p>
Also, you will not be able to use g_logOptions flag 256 (log private
messages) unless g_tyranny is enabled.
</p>
<p>
g_tyranny must also be enabled in order to specify a client in
using the 'playsound' server command.
</p>
<p>
'g_tyranny' and its value appear in the serverInfo string to serve
as a warning for perspective players.
</p>
<p>
<b>NOTE:</b> If you enable this, you MUST do so immediately when the server
	starts (before the first map is loaded).  This means putting
	<pre>set g_tyranny 1 </pre> in the .cfg file that is exec'ed on
	server start.  If you try to change this on a running server,
	you will get the message <pre>g_tyranny is read only.</pre>

<p>
Default is 0
</p>
<dt>g_mapScriptDirectory [string]
<dd>
<p>
Similar to ETPro's b_mapscriptsdirectory.  Set it to the name of a
directory in your fs_path that contains custom map scripts.
</p>
<p>
For example you can copy the 'etpromapscripts' directory from the
ETPro distribution to your 'etpub' directory and add: <pre>
set g_mapScriptDirectory "etpromapscripts"</pre> to your cfg.
</p>
<p>
Setting this to &quot;&quot; disables it.
</p>
<p>
Default is &quot;&quot;
</p>


<dt>g_campaignFile [string]
<dd>
<p>Similar to ETPro's b_campaignFile.  If you set this to the name
of a file in your fs_path it will be interpreted as a .campaign
script and all other .campaign scripts in your pk3 files will be
ignored.
</p>
<p>
This is useful for making custom campaigns since you don't need to
offer a pk3 file containing a custom .campaign script for all clients
to download.  However, if the client has not downloaded this .campaign
file in a pk3, they will not see information about the campaign.
Such information includes:
	<ul>
	<li>will not display in the VOTE -> MAP list
	<li>map locations will not draw on the map of Europe.
	<li>campaign description will not draw in the right panel
	<li>total number of maps and current maps order in the campaign
            will not be shown in the intermission screens.
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
Also, even though the built-in campaigns cmpgn_centraleurope and
cmpgn_northafrica will not be valid, they will still appear in the
client's VOTE -> MAP menu.  If a vote for one of them passes, nothing
will happen.
</p>

<a name="g_fear"></a>
<dt>g_fear [integer]
<dd>
<p>
If a player uses the /kill command within g_fear milliseconds after
taking damage from an enemy, the attacker that last damaged that player
will recieve full credit for the kill and the mode of death will be
recorded as MOD_FEAR.  Other restrictions are that the attacker must be
on the opposite team and the attacker must still be alive.
</p>

<p>
In-game statistics will reflect that the death
was caused by the weapon that did the last recorded damage to the player.

</p>

<p>Available options are:
	<dl>
	<dt>0
	<dd>Obituaries are disabled.

	<dt>1
	<dd>All Obituaries will ALWAYS be handled by the client with
	the EV_OBITUARY event.  Since the etmain client does not know
	about some etpub MODs (e.g. MOD_GOOMBA) the default message
	will be printed for those deaths.

	<dt>2
	<dd>Only those Obituaries that the etmain client knows how to handle
	will be handled by the client.  If someone is killed by a MOD that
	the etmain client doesn't know about, the Obituary is generated by the
	server.

	<dt>3
	<dd>All Obituaries are handled by the server and the EV_OBITUARY event
	is never sent to the client.  This results in
	&quot;Instant Obituaries&quot;.  This comes at the cost of increased

<a name="statistics"></a><h3>Statistics / Rankings Terms</h3>
<p>There are several settings in ETPub that attempt to determine how "good" a player is
in terms (hopefully) more meaningful than just XP or XP per unit of time.  Here are the
terms used and their definitions:</p>

<dl>
<dt>Kill Rating
<dd><p>How good of a killer the player is, based on how many other players the player kills,
and their kill rating.  In other words, killing players with a high kill rating increases
the shooter's kill rating more than killing players with a low kill rating.</p>

<dt>Player Rating
<dd><p>This is a measure of how much the player contributes to winning a map.  This
measure is calculated by seeing how many times this player is on the winning team after
every map, and how good the opposing team was. Like kill rating, winning against teams with a high average player rating results in player rating increasing faster.</p>

<dt>Win Probability
<dd><p>The probability that a team will win a map (based on the players' player rating,
team size, and the map).</p>

</dl>

<p>These statistics are gathered by etpub and the data is saved to local files on disk.</p>

<p>The etpub development team member responsible for implementing these player rankings and
ratings is Josh Menke.  He has been kind enough to begin working on an academic write-up
to explain the mathematics and statistics methods behind these rankings.  Due to time
constraints the document is being gradually updated and expanded. The latest version can
be seen at:

<a name="consolecommands"></a><h3>Server Console Commands</h3>
<p>The following server console commands (for use in the server console or
through rcon) commands have been added in etpub:

<dl>

<dt>chat [message]
<dd>
<p>Display a message to all users in the chat area</p>

<dt>chatclient [slot#|name] [message]
<dd>
<p>Display a message to a specific user in the chat area.  A partial name match can be
used, and in this case the message will be sent to all users that match the partial name</p>

<dt>clearxp
<dd>
<p>Clears the XP of all users</p>

<dt>cp [message]
<dd>
<p>Display a message to all users in the center of the screen</p>

<dt>cpmsay [message]
<dd>
<p>Display a message to all users in the popup message area of the screen</p>

<dt>forcecvar [cvar] [value]
<dd>
<p>Forces a client cvar to have a certain value for all clients</p>

<dt>m [slot#|name] [message]
<dd>
<p>Send a private message to a player. A partial name match can be used, and in
this case the private message will be sent to all users that match the partial
name</p>

<dt>playsound [filename]
<dd>
<p>Plays the specified sound file.  All players hear the sound.</p>

<dt>ratingsinfo
<dd>
<p> Returns the ratings points that would be granted to either team if they won the
current map</p>

<dt>readxp
<dd>
<p>(Requires that g_tyranny be enabled) Loads the XPSave
file from disk.  There is no reason to call this function, etpub loads the XPSave
file automatically as needed.</p>

<dt>writexp
<dd>
<p>Commits the in-memory XPSave info to disk.  Normally,
etpub does this automatically every time a map ends or the server is shut down.</p>

</dl>

<p>Additionally, all of the shrubbot commands can be used on the server console as well, the
leading "!" is optional.</p>

<hr>
<a name="shrubbot"></a><h3>Shrubbot</h3>
<p>
shrubbot is an <a href="http://www.etstats.com/shrubet/index.php?ver=2&id=10">
invention</a> of Ryan Mannion.  etpub tries to clone shubbot as accurately
as possible, both in user interface and in the shrubbot configuration file
(usually called "shrubbot.cfg").
</p>

Below are the shrubbot commands that etpub currently supports and the
corresponding flag to be used in the shrubbot config file to give permission
to the command:

The following flags are also supported:
<dl>
<dt>1
<dd>cannot be vote kicked, vote muted, dropped from inactivity, or
        complained against.
<dt>2
<dd>cannot be censored
<dt>3
<dd>Can run commands silently with /!COMMAND in the console
<dt>4
<dd>Can see Axis/Allies team chats as a spectator
<dt>5
<dd>can switch teams any time, regardless of balance
<dt>6
<dd>does not need to specify a reason for !kick or !ban
<dt>7
<dd>Can call a vote at any time (regardless of disabled voting
    or voting limitations)
<dt>8
<dd>does not need to specify a duration for a ban (defaults to PERMANENT)
<dt>9
<dd>Can do shrubbot commands via team and fireteam chats
</dl>

The following operators are supported in the flags field:
<dl>
<dt>*
<dd>This means all available commands are allowed.  Any flags that
    come after the * are negated.  So for example:
<pre>
[level]
level   = 5
name    =
flags   = *xU
</pre>
would give level 5 admins all commands except !lol and !burn.
<dt>-
<dd>This subtracts the flags that follow it from the allowed flags.
Example:
<pre>
[admin]
name    = tjw
guid    = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
level   = 5
flags   = -bs
</pre>
would give tjw all of the commands a level 5 admin has except !ban
and !setlevel.<br>
NOTE: this operator is for admin flags only.

<dt>+
<dd>This is pretty useless since it is implied that any flags will be
appended anyway unless they follow '-'.  Therefore, the only use for
this operator is for use after the '-' operator.
Example:
<pre>
[admin]
name    = tjw
guid    = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
level   = 5
flags   = -bs+U
</pre>
would give tjw all of the commands a level 5 user has except !ban and
!setlevel, but he also gets the !burn command which typical level 5
admins do not have.<br>
NOTE: this operator is for admin flags only.
</dl>

<p>
The configuration file itself is layed out in blocks serpated by blank lines.
The three types of blocks supported are [level], [admin], and [ban].
If you ever need to edit the shrubbot.cfg file by hand,  you need to run the
!readconfig command (or restart etded) to load it.
</p>

<p>
When setting up a new shrubbot.cfg file, simply set the g_shrubbot cvar to
the name you want to use for the configuration file, then connect to the
server with your et, and run the following command in the <b>server</b> console:
<pre>!setlevel ETPlayer 5</pre>
(where ETPlayer is your name).  This will create the shrubbot.cfg file with
default levels and your guid set to level 5 admin (the highest default level).
You can then edit the level definitions in this file to match your preferences
and run the !readconfig command to load them up.

<a name="gen"><h3>General Changes</h3>
<ul>
<li>stats are not reset when a player changes teams
<li>incorporated many of bani and rain's etpro weapon fixes that were
    <a href="http://bani.anime.net/banimod/forums/viewtopic.php?t=4138">
	published in the etpro forum</a>.
<li>used bani's self-headshot when prone fix
    <a href="http://bani.anime.net/banimod/forums/viewtopic.php?t=3475">
	published in the etpro forum</a>.
<li>used bani's oversize server command fix
    <a href="http://bani.anime.net/banimod/forums/viewtopic.php?t=2706">
	published in the etpro forum</a>.
<li> you can no longer steal a uniform from a corpse that has sunk into the world.
<li> On limited lives servers running dual objective maps, people that join after the timelimit runs out no longer get unlimited lives.
<li>XP shuffle now sorts players by the rate at which they have been gaining XP instead of the total amount of XP they have.
<li>ref commands work in the server console.
<li>shooting breakables (like windows) doesn't count for 'hits' anymore, but shooting wounded players now does.
<li>players are no longer allowed to pick up weapons if they wouldn't be allowed to switch to that weapon in the limbo menu.  (e.g. heavy weapon restrictions or the team_maxWEAPON cvars).
<li>if the time has run out on a dual objective map on a limited lives server, the round will now end if one team runs out of lives even if the objective hasn't been completed.
<li>On limited lives servers running dual objective maps, landmines can be
diffused after the time runs out.
<li><a href="http://et.tjw.org/etpub/hitboxes/">hitboxes</a> are more accurate for several player states. (see g_hitboxes)
<li>if a match is paused and nobody unpauses it, it will start back up again after match_timeoutlength seconds.
<li>on non-limited lives servers, players will no longer have a skull next to
their name after they switch teams.
<li>teams are no longer locked when the warmup countdown starts.
<li>added cp, cpmsay, cpm, chatclient, m, and priv console commands.
<li>akimbo weapons can be reloaded if only one shot has been fired.
<li>when wounded, viewlock should no longer lock on to non-medic teamates.
<li>when following a teammate, you stop following them if they switch to the
    other team.
<li>merged Chruker's bug fixes (<a href="http://games.chruker.dk/enemy_territory/modding_project_bugfix.php">Project: Bug Fix</a>)
<li>ignore and unignore client commands will now accept slot number or
    partial name match.
<li>vsay* commands recognize the ignore list
<li>clients are notified when you add/remove them from your ignore list
<li>when ignoring another client their messages will be visible in the
    console (~), but not chat.
<li>voting for Competition Settings (/callvote comp) makes the server
    try to &quot;exec default_comp.cfg&quot; instead of loading the
    built-in competition settings.
<li>voting for Public Settings (/callvote pub) makes the server try to
    &quot;exec default_pub.cfg&quot; instead of loading the built-in pub
    settings.
<li>voting for Next Map (/callvote nextmap) now loads the next map in
    the campaign instead of loading the next campaign.
<li>added vote_allow_maprestart cvar to control the existing maprestart vote.
    etmain client will still show the button in the menu even if it is
    disabled though.
<li>added <a href="obituaries.html">Custom Obituaries</a>.
