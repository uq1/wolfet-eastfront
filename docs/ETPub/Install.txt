
etpub Installation
------------------

etpub is a server side only modification.  This means that it only is 
installed on servers and clients do not need to download any files to
play on etpub servers. 

To install etpub on your server, you only need to ensure that the 
Enemy Territory binary loads the qagame shared library instead of the
default one when it is started.  Below I'll describe how to
install etpub for each of the supported platforms.

Configuration and detailed setup instructions are not covered in this
document.  See the directory docs/Example of the etpub distribution
for example configuration files and visit http://etpub.org/ for more
detailed instructions.

Linux
-----

1) Create a directory named 'etpub' next to the 'etmain' directory in either
the enemy-territory installation directory or the ~/.etwolf/ directory
of the user that runs etded.x86.  By default the game installation directory
is located at /usr/local/games/enemy-territory/

2) Copy the glibc-2.1/qagame.mp.i386.so file from the etpub distribution
to the 'etpub' directory created in step one.

3) Ensure that etded is called with the command line arguments 
' +set fs_game etpub ' (in addition to the ones you already use).

Windows
-------

1) Run setup.exe in the win32 directory.

For manual install instructions, see http://etpub.org/content.php?content.4


Mac
---

1) Double-click the etpub.pkg icon in the mac directory.

In order for this installation package to work you must have ET installed
at the default location ("/Applications/Wolfenstein ET").  

Once the installer is finished you can double click on the "etpub_server"
icon in your "Wolfenstein ET" folder to start it.  Open the .cfg files
located in "/Applications/Wolfenstein ET/etpub/" with TextEdit to 
configure etpub.

To uninstall, delete all files and folders that start with "etpub" from the 
"/Applications/Wolfenstein ET/" folder.
